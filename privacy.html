            <h3>Information Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                We use cookies to personalize our Services for you and to collect aggregate information about usage of our Services. A cookie
                is a text file or other local storage identifier provided by your browser or associated applications. We
                use cookies for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your use of our Services. The cookies
                assign random, unique numbers to your Devices to enable our systems to recognize your Devices and to allow
                us to see how you use our Services. Additional general information about cookies and how they work is available
                at
                <a href="www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The cookies we use in connection with our Services include:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Session cookies:</b> Session cookies are temporary cookies that expire and are automatically erased whenever
                you close your browser window.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Persistent cookies:</b> Persistent cookies usually have an expiration date in the distant future and remain
                in your browser until they expire or you manually delete them. We use persistent cookies to better understand
                usage patterns so we can improve our Services.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Third-party cookies:</b> We permit certain third parties to place cookies through our Services to provide
                us with better insights into the use of our Services and user demographics and to advertise our Services
                to you. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different
                websites when you access or use our Services. For example, we utilize Google Analytics to analyze usage patterns
                for our Services. Google Analytics generates a cookie to capture information about your use of our Services,
                which Google uses to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other related services. Google
                may use a portion of your IP address to identify its cookie, but this will not be associated with any other
                data held by Google. We may also permit third-party service providers to place cookies for our Services,
                as indicated above, to perform analytic or marketing functions where you are notified of them and you have
                consented to the usage. We do not control the use of such third-party cookies or the resulting information,
                and we are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
                <br>
                <br> By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the placement of cookies on your Devices as described
                in this Privacy Policy. If you prefer not to receive cookies through our Services, you may control how your
                browser responds to cookies by adjusting the privacy and security settings of your web browser. Unless you
                set your browser settings to refuse all cookies, our system may issue cookies when you access or use our
                Services. If you set your browser settings to refuse all cookies, the performance of certain features of
                our Services may be limited or not work at all.
            </p>

            <p>

                event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, your Personal Information may be
                one of the transferred assets); (5) if the information is provided to our third-party service providers to
                perform functions on our behalf (e.g., analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing customer
                service, processing orders, etc.); (6) for our everyday business purposes; or (7) as permitted by applicable
                law or otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. When you are no longer our customer, we continue to share

            <p>Subject to applicable law, which might, from time to time, oblige us to store your Personal Information for a
                certain period of time, we will respect your wishes to correct inaccurate information. Otherwise, we will
                hold your Personal Information for as long as we believe it will help us achieve our objectives as detailed
                in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>You can ask us whether we are storing your Personal Information and you can ask to receive a copy of that Personal
                Information. Before sending you any Personal Information, we will ask you to provide proof of your identity.
                If you are not able to provide proof of your identity, we reserve the right to refuse to send you any Personal
                Information. We will respond as quickly as we can to your requests for details of Personal Information we
                hold about you.</p>
            <h3>Information You Share Socially</h3>
            <p>
                Our Services may allow you to connect and share your actions, comments, content, and information publicly or with friends.
                We are not responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any information you share publicly or with
                friends via any means.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Services may also allow you to connect with us on, share on, and use third-party websites, applications, and services.
                Please be mindful of your personal privacy needs and the privacy needs of others, as you choose whom to connect
                with and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose
                to make public or share with others. We also do not control the privacy practices of third parties. Please
                contact those sites and services directly if you want to learn about their privacy practices.
            </p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
                We have, and require our third-party service providers that receive Personal Information from us to have, a comprehensive
                written information security program that contains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for
                our respective physical facilities and in our respective computer systems, databases, and communications
                networks that are reasonably designed to protect information contained within such systems from loss, misuse,
                or alteration. When your bank account information is transmitted via our Services, it will be protected by
                encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
            </p>
            <p>
                No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your
                Personal Information. You also play a role in protecting your Personal Information. Please safeguard your
                email for your City Connect account and do not share them with others. If we receive instructions using your
                City Connect account login information, we will consider that you have authorized the instructions. You agree
                to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your City Connect account or any other breach of security.
                We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to refuse to provide our Services, terminate City Connect accounts,
                and to remove or edit content.
            </p>
            <h3>Links to Third-Party Websites</h3>
            <p>
                When you use our Services, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control. We may also allow third-party
                websites or applications to link to our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any
                third parties or the content of linked websites, but we do encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies
                and terms and conditions of such parties and websites. This Privacy Policy only applies to our Services.
            </p>
            <h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
                Subject to applicable law, we may revise this Privacy Policy at any time and in our sole discretion. When we revise this
                Privacy Policy, we will post the revised version via our Services and will update the date at the top of
                this Privacy Policy. The revised Privacy Policy will be effective upon posting via our Services, unless otherwise
                set forth therein or as otherwise required by applicable law. You are free to decide whether or not to accept
                a revised version of this Privacy Policy, but accepting this Privacy Policy, as revised, is required for
                you to continue accessing or using our Services. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy
                or any revised version of this Privacy Policy, your sole recourse is to terminate your access and use of
                our Services. Except as otherwise expressly stated by us, your access and use of our Services is subject
